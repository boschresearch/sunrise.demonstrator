This repository provides a minimal demonstration of the **SUNRISE** infrastructure.

**SUNRISE** stands for _**S**calable **Un**ified **R**ESTful **I**nfrastructure for **S**ystem **E**valuation_. It offers users a uniform approach to utilizing simulation technologies, typically, but not limited to the context of virtual prototyping.
The goal is to facilitate access to diverse simulation solutions and boost cooperation by leveraging decentralized compute resources and defining open APIs.


## Getting Started
**This is in work :construction:**


## Contributing
A core goal of SUNRISE is to connect parties in the industry to improve efficiency in the domain of simulation.
Therefore, we strongly encourage anyone interested to bring input to the project, preferably through code contributions.

Questions and requests can be raised via **GitHub issues**.
